SimpleDelegate
==============

A test app that requires a custom delegate protocol is written for a table view cell

###Step 1: Here is how the app is set up
- An app with a UITableViewController
- The datasource returns 2 rows
- The first row shows a value (starting with 0)
- The second row is a custom cell with a button. 

##Your Task:
*Everytime the button is pressed it should increment the number by 1.*

###Step 2: Follow the delegation example:
- https://github.com/DevMountain/Delegation
- Define the protocol
- Adopt and implement the protocol
- Call the method from your defining class

**Black Diamond**: *Add 2 buttons. One that increments and one that decrement the number.*
